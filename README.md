# diy-spotify-wrapped
An interactive app that visualizes your Spotify listening trends over time (up to 1 year).

This project is an interactive web app that lets users explore their Spotify listening data over a custom time frame — not just generic "last month," "6 months," or "all-time" summaries. Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, the app pulls personalized streaming data via the Spotify Web API and allows users to:

Authenticate securely with their Spotify account

View their top songs, artists, and genres

Slide between different time windows from the past year to the present

Generate clean, visual summaries to share (charts, infographics, etc.)

The goal is to build something resume-worthy and engaging, blending data scraping, visualization, and interactivity — with potential to share outputs to platforms like Instagram.
